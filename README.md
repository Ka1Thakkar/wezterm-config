# WezTerm Configuration

This repository contains my configuration for [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator, optimized for performance and usability on Windows.

## Features

- **Custom Keybindings**: Streamlined keyboard shortcuts for common tasks.
- **Appearance Settings**: Customized font, colors, and window transparency.
- **Shell Integration**: Configured for compatibility with WSL and PowerShell.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ka1Thakkar/wezterm-config.git
   ```
2. Copy wezterm.lua or other configuration files to your WezTerm config directory; on Windows, this is typically:
   ```bash
    C:\Users\YourUsername\
    ```
3. Open WezTerm to see the new settings in effect.

You can save this markdown text as `README.md` in your WezTerm configuration repository.
